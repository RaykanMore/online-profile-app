Hello and welcome to the my-online-portfolio-app app :)

To run this app on your local machine, make sure you have all the needed software and a package manager of your choice.

Start off by cloning this repository into your machine.
Open the project in your IDE of choice and cd to the folder using the terminal.
install all the required modules using your package manager. ie:
    yarn (if you are using yarn),
    npm i (if you are using npm).
When the installs are done and the node_modules folder has been created in your file structure, run the app and enjoy.

Let me know of any cool and creative improvement you make.

for any collaboration, pop me an email with your proposal at raykan.more@gmail.com and let us collaborate.

Enjoy :)
